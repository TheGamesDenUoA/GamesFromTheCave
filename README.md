# Games Den Games

The Games Den is University of Alberta's game development student club.
Here, we're making a colleciton of minigames that act as a collage showcasing member talent.
The shared project is an opportunity to collaborate and work with club members on various minigames.
It is
- Open to all skill levels and abilities
  - Whether you're a game dev veteran have zero experience with game dev, there are opportunities for you
- Collaborative
- Not-for-profit
- Low commitment
  - You can contribute 0 hours or 1000 hours
- Low pressure
  - We're not making "game of year here". Your ugly stickman drawing is absolutely welcome. Contributions that mesh well together will be curated into separate releases.

# Rules
- All contribtions are freely licensed
  - Art, Audio, etc is licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
  - Code is licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit)
- A contribution must add something to the game and not leave gaps
  - This is to prevent scope creep (a game's design becoming too complex to implement)
  - For example, you can't add a new 'item graphic' to a game that does not have items
- Contributions must follow guidlines set by each game project
- Keep contributions safe-for-work and use common sense.
